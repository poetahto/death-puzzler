level 0 [Cubits]
- This is a story about the creatures called "Cubits".
- Their lives were simple:
- 1 - They were born.
- 2 - They ate.
- 3 - They died.

level 1 
- There were few problems a lone Cubit could solve.
- There were few problems a group of Cubit's could not solve.

level 2 [Polydria]
- In some ways, the forest Polydria was kind to the Cubits.
- However, for many other of Polydria's inhabitants, the struggle had recently become far worse.
- Eventually, the Cubit's could no longer bear to watch the other species suffering.
- Perhaps this kindness came from the same instinct that allowed them to lay down their lives so easily for others.
- But they could not save them all.

level 3 [The Wise One]
- It was rumored that a lived a wise Polydrian lived deep in the forest.
- Perhaps this creature knew how to stop the sickness that had spread through the forest.

level 4
- The Cubits could feel that their destination was within grasp; and despite the forests best efforts to stop them, they pushed onward, towards the Wise One.
